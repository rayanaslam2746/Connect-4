# Connect 4
This Connect 4 game is made using only Java to create working game logic, graphics, and animation!

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** Java, Java Swing

The basic format of the game is a Java Swing grid full of interactive buttons. After coding the basic logic of the game, I drew in graphics with MS Paint and played around with delays to implement animations to simulate pieces falling down.

## Lessons Learned:
While most of the technical skills learned through this project are not very applicable to modern software engineering, this project was valuable for my growth because it was the first time I really pushed myself to think of solutions for complex problems. For example, adding the animations of pieces falling in from the top proved to be more challenging than I thought, as I had to learn about delays and percisely calibrate the numbers to make everything run smoothly.
